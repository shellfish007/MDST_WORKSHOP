I'm a junior student major in CS. I'm currently in EECS281 and EECS376. I really hope to get hands on experience on doing projects with a group and at the same time, 
I hope to be more fluent in using python to code. Besides, I'm really looking forward to studying and progressing with a group of people with same interest, that's why
I signed up for this team.
